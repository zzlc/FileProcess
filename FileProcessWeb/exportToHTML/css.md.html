</span><span class="s1"># </span><span class="s0">The CSS 
 
HTML5 Boilerplate's CSS includes: 
 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">[Normalize.css](#normalizecss) 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">[Useful defaults](#useful-defaults) 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">[Common helpers](#common-helpers) 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">[Placeholder media queries](#media-queries) 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">[Print styles](#print-styles) 
 
This starting CSS does not rely on the presence of 
[conditional class names](https://www.paulirish.com/2008/conditional-stylesheets-vs-css-hacks-answer-neither/), 
[conditional style sheets](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-an-ie-only-stylesheet/), 
or [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/), and it is ready to use no matter what 
your development preferences happen to be. 
 
 
</span><span class="s1">## </span><span class="s0">Normalize.css 
 
In order to make browsers render all elements more consistently and in line 
with modern standards, we include 
[Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) — a modern, HTML5-ready 
alternative to CSS resets. 
 
As opposed to CSS resets, Normalize.css: 
 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">targets only the styles that need normalizing 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">preserves useful browser defaults rather than erasing them 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">corrects bugs and common browser inconsistencies 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">improves usability with subtle improvements 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">doesn't clutter the debugging tools 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">has better documentation 
 
For more information about Normalize.css, please refer to its [project 
page](https://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/), as well as this 
[blog post](http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-normalize-css/). 
 
 
</span><span class="s1">## </span><span class="s0">Useful defaults 
 
Several base styles are included that build upon </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">Normalize.css</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">. These 
styles: 
 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">provide basic typography settings that improve text readability 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">protect against unwanted </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">text-shadow</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">during text highlighting 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">tweak the default alignment of some elements (e.g.: </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">img</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">, </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">video</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">, 
  </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">fieldset</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">, </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">textarea</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">) 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">style the prompt that is displayed to users using an outdated browser 
 
You are free and even encouraged to modify or add to these base styles as your 
project requires. 
 
 
</span><span class="s1">## </span><span class="s0">Common helpers 
 
Along with the base styles, we also provide some commonly used helper classes. 
 
</span><span class="s1">#### </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">.hidden</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0"> 
 
The </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">hidden</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">class can be added to any element that you want to hide visually 
and from screen readers. It could be an element that will be populated and 
displayed later, or an element you will hide with JavaScript. 
 
</span><span class="s1">#### </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">.visuallyhidden</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0"> 
 
The </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">visuallyhidden</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">class can be added to any element that you want to hide 
visually, while still have its content accessible to screen readers.

__N.B.__ [The visuallyhidden class can be an accessibility issue for users using high contrast modes.](https://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2012/08/notes-on-accessible-css-image-sprites/) 
 
</span><span class="s1">&gt;</span><span class="s0">Use JavaScript to detect when images are disabled and remove the CSS visually hidden display state of the text alternative. 
Use JavaScript to detect when Windows high contrast mode is enabled and remove the CSS visually hidden display state of the text alternative. 
 
</span><span class="s1">#### </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">.invisible</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0"> 
 
The </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">invisible</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">class can be added to any element that you want to hide 
visually and from screen readers, but without affecting the layout. 
 
As opposed to the </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">hidden</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">class that effectively removes the element from the 
layout, the </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">invisible</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">class will simply make the element invisible while 
keeping it in the flow and not affecting the positioning of the surrounding 
content. 
 
__N.B.__ Try to stay away from, and don't use the classes specified above for 
[keyword stuffing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyword_stuffing) as you will 
harm your site's ranking! 
 
</span><span class="s1">#### </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">.clearfix</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0"> 
 
The </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">clearfix</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">class can be added to any element to ensure that it always fully 
contains its floated children. 
 
Over the years there have been many variants of the clearfix hack, but currently, 
we use the [micro clearfix](http://nicolasgallagher.com/micro-clearfix-hack/). 
 
 
</span><span class="s1">## </span><span class="s0">Media Queries 
 
HTML5 Boilerplate makes it easy for you to get started with a 
[_mobile first_](https://www.lukew.com/presos/preso.asp?26) and [_responsive web 
design_](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design) approach to 
development. But it's worth remembering that there are [no silver 
bullets](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/css-media-query-for-mobile-is-fools-gold/). 
 
We include placeholder media queries to help you build up your mobile styles for 
wider viewports and high-resolution displays. It's recommended that you adapt 
these media queries based on the content of your site rather than mirroring the 
fixed dimensions of specific devices. 
 
If you do not want to take the _mobile first_ approach, you can simply edit or 
remove these placeholder media queries. One possibility would be to work from 
wide viewports down, and use </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">max-width</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">media queries instead (e.g.: 
</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">@media only screen and (max-width: 480px)</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">). 
 
 
</span><span class="s1">## </span><span class="s0">Print styles 
 
Lastly, we provide some useful print styles that will optimize the printing 
process, as well as make the printed pages easier to read. 
 
At printing time, these styles will: 
 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">strip all background colors, change the font color to black, and remove the 
  </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">text-shadow</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">— done in order to [help save printer ink and speed up the 
  printing process](http://www.sanbeiji.com/archives/953) 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">underline and expand links to include the URL — done in order to allow users 
  to know where to refer to&lt;br&gt; 
  (exceptions to this are: the links that are 
  [fragment identifiers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#attr-href), 
  or use the 
  [</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">javascript:</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">pseudo protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/void#JavaScript_URIs)) 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">expand abbreviations to include the full description — done in order to allow 
  users to know what the abbreviations stands for 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">provide instructions on how browsers should break the content into pages and 
  on [orphans/widows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widows_and_orphans), namely, 
  we instruct 
  [supporting browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_layout_engines_%28Cascading_Style_Sheets%29#Grammar_and_rules) 
  that they should: 
 
  </span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">ensure the table header (</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">&lt;thead&gt;</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">) is [printed on each page spanned by the 
    table](http://css-discuss.incutio.com/wiki/Printing_Tables) 
  </span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">prevent block quotations, preformatted text, images and table rows from 
    being split onto two different pages 
  </span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">ensure that headings never appear on a different page than the text they 
    are associated with 
  </span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">ensure that 
    [orphans and widows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widows_and_orphans) do 
    [not appear on printed pages](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/orphans/) 
 
The print styles are included along with the other </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">css</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">to [avoid the 
additional HTTP request](http://www.phpied.com/delay-loading-your-print-css/). 
Also, they should always be included last, so that the other styles can be 
overwritten.
