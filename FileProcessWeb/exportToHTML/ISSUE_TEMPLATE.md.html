</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests (use 
  [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/html5boilerplate)). 
 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and 
  respect the opinions of others. 
 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">Please **do not** open issues or pull requests regarding the code in

</span><span class="s1">## </span><span class="s0">Bug reports 
 
A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository. 
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you! 
 
Guidelines for bug reports: 
 
</span><span class="s1">1. </span><span class="s0">**Use the GitHub issue search** &amp;mdash; check if the issue has already been 
   reported. 
 
   We have a long history of sometimes _very_ detailed discussion of every line of code 
   in the project. We want discussion, so it might still warrant an issue. It 
   just helps to get the (sometimes extensive) context. 
 
</span><span class="s1">2. </span><span class="s0">**Check if the issue has been fixed** &amp;mdash; try to reproduce it using the 
   latest </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">master</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">or development branch in the repository. 
 
</span><span class="s1">3. </span><span class="s0">**Isolate the problem** &amp;mdash; ideally create a [reduced test 
   case](https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) and a live example. 
 
A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more 
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is 
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS 
experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these 
details will help people to fix any potential bugs. 
 
Example: 
 
</span><span class="s1">&gt; </span><span class="s0">Short and descriptive example bug report title 
&gt; 
&gt; A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If 
</span><span class="s1">&gt; </span><span class="s0">suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug. 
&gt; 
&gt; </span><span class="s1">1. </span><span class="s0">This is the first step 
&gt; </span><span class="s1">2. </span><span class="s0">This is the second step 
&gt; </span><span class="s1">3. </span><span class="s0">Further steps, etc. 
&gt; 
&gt; </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">&lt;url&gt;</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">- a link to the reduced test case 
&gt; 
&gt; Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being 
</span><span class="s1">&gt; </span><span class="s0">reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as 
</span><span class="s1">&gt; </span><span class="s0">causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their 
</span><span class="s1">&gt; </span><span class="s0">merits). 
 
 
</span><span class="s1">## </span><span class="s0">Feature requests 
 
Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea 
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong 
case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please 
provide as much detail and context as possible.
