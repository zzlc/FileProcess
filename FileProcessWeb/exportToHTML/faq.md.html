</span><span class="s1">### </span><span class="s0">Why is the Google Analytics code at the bottom? Google recommends it be placed in the </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">&lt;head&gt;</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">. 
 
The main advantage of placing it in the </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">&lt;head&gt;</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">is that you will track the 
user's </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">pageview</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">even if they leave the page before it has been fully loaded. 
 
Here's a handy quote from [Mathias Bynens](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/async-analytics-snippet#comment-50) about our placement choice. 
</span><span class="s1">&gt;</span><span class="s0">I should point out that it’s Google — not me — recommending to place this 
script before all other scripts in the document. The only real advantage is to 
catch a pageView call if your page fails to load completely (for example, if 
the user aborts loading, or quickly closes the page, etc.). Personally, I 
wouldn’t count that as a page view, so I actually prefer to place this script 
at the bottom, after all other scripts. This keeps all the scripts together and 
reinforces that scripts at the bottom are the right move. (Usually I 
concatenate and minify all my scripts into one .js file — the GA snippet being 
the suffix.) 
 
</span><span class="s1">### </span><span class="s0">How can I integrate [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) with HTML5 Boilerplate? 
 
Here's Nicolas Gallagher writing about how [HTML5 Boilerplate and Bootstrap complement each 
other](https://www.quora.com/Is-Bootstrap-a-complement-or-an-alternative-to-HTML5-Boilerplate-or-viceversa/answer/Nicolas-Gallagher). 
 
</span><span class="s1">### </span><span class="s0">Do I need to upgrade my site each time a new version of HTML5 Boilerplate is released? 
 
No, same as you don't normally replace the foundation of a house once it 
was built. However, there is nothing stopping you from trying to work in the 
latest changes, but you'll have to assess the costs/benefits of doing so.
