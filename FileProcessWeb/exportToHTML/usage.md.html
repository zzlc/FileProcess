</span><span class="s1"># </span><span class="s0">Usage 
 
The most basic usage of HTML5 Boilerplate is to create a static site or simple 
app. Once you've downloaded or cloned the project, that process looks something 
like this: 
 
</span><span class="s1">1. </span><span class="s0">Set up the basic structure of the site. 
</span><span class="s1">2. </span><span class="s0">Add some content, style, and functionality. 
</span><span class="s1">3. </span><span class="s0">Run your site locally to see how it looks. 
</span><span class="s1">4. </span><span class="s0">Deploy your site. 
 
Cool, right? _It is_. That said, the smart defaults, baseline elements, default 
attribute values and various other utilities that HTML5 Boilerplate offers can 
serve as the foundation for whatever you're interested in building. 
 
Even the basic use-case of a simple static site can be enhanced by manipulating 
the code through an automated build process. Moving up in complexity HTML5 
Boilerplate can be integrated with whatever front-end framework, CMS or 
e-commerce platform you're working with. Mix-and-match to your heart's content. 
Use what you need (toss it in a blender if you need to) and discard the rest. 
HTML5 Boilerplate is a starting point, not a destination.

A basic HTML5 Boilerplate site initially looks something like this:
