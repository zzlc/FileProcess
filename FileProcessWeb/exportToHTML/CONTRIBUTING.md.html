<span class="s0"># </span><span class="s1">Contributing to HTML5 Boilerplate 
 
â™¥ [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) and want to get involved? 
Thanks! We're actively looking for folks interested in helping out and there  
are plenty of ways you can help! 
 
Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution 
process easy and effective for everyone involved. 
 
Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of 
the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, 
they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing 
patches and features. 
 
 
</span><span class="s0">## </span><span class="s1">Using the issue tracker 
 
The [issue tracker](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/issues) is 
the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bugs), [features requests](#features) 
and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests), but please respect the following 
restrictions: 
 
</span><span class="s0">* </span><span class="s1">Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests (use 
  [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/html5boilerplate)). 
 
</span><span class="s0">* </span><span class="s1">Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and 
  respect the opinions of others. 
 
</span><span class="s0">* </span><span class="s1">Please **do not** open issues or pull requests regarding the code in 
  [</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s1">.htaccess</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s1">](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache), 
  [</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s1">jQuery</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s1">](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/), 
  [</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s1">Modernizr</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s1">](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr) or

  their respective repositories). 
 
 
&lt;a name=&quot;bugs&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
</span><span class="s0">## </span><span class="s1">Bug reports 
 
A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository. 
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you! 
 
Guidelines for bug reports: 
 
</span><span class="s0">1. </span><span class="s1">**Use the GitHub issue search** &amp;mdash; check if the issue has already been 
   reported. 
 
</span><span class="s0">2. </span><span class="s1">**Check if the issue has been fixed** &amp;mdash; try to reproduce it using the 
   latest </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s1">master</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s1">or development branch in the repository. 
 
</span><span class="s0">3. </span><span class="s1">**Isolate the problem** &amp;mdash; ideally create a [reduced test 
   case](https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) and a live example. 
 
A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more 
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is 
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS 
experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these 
details will help people to fix any potential bugs. 
 
Example: 
 
</span><span class="s0">&gt; </span><span class="s1">Short and descriptive example bug report title 
&gt; 
&gt; A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If 
</span><span class="s0">&gt; </span><span class="s1">suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug. 
&gt; 
&gt; </span><span class="s0">1. </span><span class="s1">This is the first step 
&gt; </span><span class="s0">2. </span><span class="s1">This is the second step 
&gt; </span><span class="s0">3. </span><span class="s1">Further steps, etc. 
&gt; 
&gt; </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s1">&lt;url&gt;</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s1">- a link to the reduced test case 
&gt; 
&gt; Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being 
</span><span class="s0">&gt; </span><span class="s1">reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as 
</span><span class="s0">&gt; </span><span class="s1">causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their 
</span><span class="s0">&gt; </span><span class="s1">merits). 
 
 
&lt;a name=&quot;features&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
</span><span class="s0">## </span><span class="s1">Feature requests 
 
Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea 
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong 
case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please 
provide as much detail and context as possible. 
 
 
&lt;a name=&quot;pull-requests&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
</span><span class="s0">## </span><span class="s1">Pull requests 
 
Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic 
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated 
commits. 
 
**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. 
implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language), 
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the 
project's developers might not want to merge into the project. 
 
Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation, 
accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage). 
 
Adhering to the following process is the best way to get your work 
included in the project: 
 
</span><span class="s0">1. </span><span class="s1">[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your 
   fork, and configure the remotes: 
 
   </span><span class="s2">```bash</span><span class="s1"> 
   </span><span class="s2"># Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory</span><span class="s1"> 
   </span><span class="s2">git clone https://github.com/&lt;your-username&gt;/html5-boilerplate.git</span><span class="s1"> 
   </span><span class="s2"># Navigate to the newly cloned directory</span><span class="s1"> 
   </span><span class="s2">cd html5-boilerplate</span><span class="s1"> 
   </span><span class="s2"># Assign the original repo to a remote called &quot;upstream&quot;</span><span class="s1"> 
   </span><span class="s2">git remote add upstream https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate.git</span><span class="s1"> 
</span><span class="s2">   ```</span><span class="s1"> 
 
</span><span class="s0">2. </span><span class="s1">If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream: 
 
   </span><span class="s2">```bash</span><span class="s1"> 
   </span><span class="s2">git checkout master</span><span class="s1"> 
   </span><span class="s2">git pull upstream master</span><span class="s1"> 
</span><span class="s2">   ```</span><span class="s1"> 
 
</span><span class="s0">3. </span><span class="s1">Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to 
   contain your feature, change, or fix: 
 
   </span><span class="s2">```bash</span><span class="s1"> 
   </span><span class="s2">git checkout -b &lt;topic-branch-name&gt;</span><span class="s1"> 
</span><span class="s2">   ```</span><span class="s1"> 
 
</span><span class="s0">4. </span><span class="s1">Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these [git commit 
   message guidelines](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) 
   or your code is unlikely be merged into the main project. Use Git's 
   [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/) 
   feature to tidy up your commits before making them public. 
 
</span><span class="s0">5. </span><span class="s1">Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch: 
 
   </span><span class="s2">```bash</span><span class="s1"> 
   </span><span class="s2">git pull [--rebase] upstream master</span><span class="s1"> 
</span><span class="s2">   ```</span><span class="s1"> 
 
</span><span class="s0">6. </span><span class="s1">Push your topic branch up to your fork: 
 
   </span><span class="s2">```bash</span><span class="s1"> 
   </span><span class="s2">git push origin &lt;topic-branch-name&gt;</span><span class="s1"> 
</span><span class="s2">   ```</span><span class="s1"> 
 
</span><span class="s0">7. </span><span class="s1">[Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) 
    with a clear title and description.
