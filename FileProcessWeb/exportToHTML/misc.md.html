</span><span class="s1">## </span><span class="s0">.gitignore 
 
HTML5 Boilerplate includes a basic project-level </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">.gitignore</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">. This should 
primarily be used to avoid certain project-level files and directories from 
being kept under source control. Different development-environments will 
benefit from different collections of ignores. 
 
OS-specific and editor-specific files should be ignored using a &quot;global 
ignore&quot; that applies to all repositories on your system. 
 
For example, add the following to your </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">~/.gitconfig</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">, where the </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">.gitignore</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0"> 
in your HOME directory contains the files and directories you'd like to 
globally ignore: 
 
</span><span class="s2">```gitignore</span><span class="s0"> 
</span><span class="s2">[core]</span><span class="s0"> 
</span><span class="s2">    excludesfile = ~/.gitignore</span><span class="s0"> 
</span><span class="s2">```</span><span class="s0"> 
 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">More on global ignores: https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/ 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">Comprehensive set of ignores on GitHub: https://github.com/github/gitignore 
 
 
</span><span class="s1">## </span><span class="s0">.editorconfig 
 
The </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">.editorconfig</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">file is provided in order to encourage and help you and 
your team define and maintain consistent coding styles between different 
editors and IDEs. 
 
By default, </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">.editorconfig</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">includes some basic 
[properties](http://editorconfig.org/#supported-properties) that reflect the 
coding styles from the files provided by default, but you can easily change 
them to better suit your needs. 
 
In order for your editor/IDE to apply the 
[properties](http://editorconfig.org/#supported-properties) from the 
</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">.editorconfig</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">file, you may need to [install a 
plugin]( http://editorconfig.org/#download). 
 
__N.B.__ If you aren't using the server configurations provided by HTML5 
Boilerplate, we highly encourage you to configure your server to block 
access to </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">.editorconfig</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">files, as they can disclose sensitive information! 
 
For more details, please refer to the [EditorConfig 
project](http://editorconfig.org/). 
 
 
</span><span class="s1">## </span><span class="s0">Server Configuration 
 
H5BP includes a [</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">.htaccess</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">](#htaccess) file for the [Apache HTTP 
server](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/). If you are not using Apache 
as your web server, then you are encouraged to download a 
[server configuration](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs) that 
corresponds to your web server and environment. 
 
A </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">.htaccess</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">(hypertext access) file is an [Apache HTTP server 
configuration file](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache). 
The </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">.htaccess</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">file is mostly used for: 
 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">Rewriting URLs 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">Controlling cache 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">Authentication 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">Server-side includes 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">Redirects 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">Gzipping 
 
If you have access to the main server configuration file (usually called 
</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">httpd.conf</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">), you should add the logic from the </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">.htaccess</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">file in, for 
example, a &lt;Directory&gt; section in the main configuration file. This is usually 
the recommended way, as using .htaccess files slows down Apache! 
 
To enable Apache modules locally, please see: 
https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache/wiki/How-to-enable-Apache-modules. 
 
In the repo the </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">.htaccess</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">is used for: 
 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">Allowing cross-origin access to web fonts 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">CORS header for images when browsers request it 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">Enable </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">404.html</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">as 404 error document 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">Making the website experience better for IE users better 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">Media UTF-8 as character encoding for </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">text/html</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">and </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">text/plain</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0"> 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">Enabling the rewrite URLs engine 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">Forcing or removing the </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">www.</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">at the begin of a URL 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">It blocks access to directories without a default document 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">It blocks access to files that can expose sensitive information. 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">It reduces MIME type security risks 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">It forces compressing (gzipping) 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">It tells the browser whether they should request a specific file from the 
  server or whether they should grab it from the browser's cache 
 
When using </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">.htaccess</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">we recommend reading all inline comments (the rules after 
a </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">#</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">) in the file once. There is a bunch of optional stuff in it. 
 
If you want to know more about the </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">.htaccess</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">file check out the 
[Apache HTTP server docs](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/) or more 
specifically the [htaccess 
section](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/htaccess.html). 
 
Notice that the original repo for the </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">.htaccess</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">file is [this 
one](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache). 
 
 
</span><span class="s1">## </span><span class="s0">robots.txt 
 
The </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">robots.txt</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">file is used to give instructions to web robots on what can 
be crawled from the website. 
 
By default, the file provided by this project includes the next two lines: 
 
</span><span class="s1"> * </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">User-agent: *</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">-  the following rules apply to all web robots 
</span><span class="s1"> * </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">Disallow:</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">- everything on the website is allowed to be crawled 
 
If you want to disallow certain pages you will need to specify the path in a 
</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">Disallow</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">directive (e.g.: </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">Disallow: /path</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">) or, if you want to disallow 
crawling of all content, use </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">Disallow: /</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">. 
 
The </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">/robots.txt</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">file is not intended for access control, so don't try to 
use it as such. Think of it as a &quot;No Entry&quot; sign, rather than a locked door. 
URLs disallowed by the </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">robots.txt</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">file might still be indexed without being 
crawled, and the content from within the </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">robots.txt</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">file can be viewed by 
anyone, potentially disclosing the location of your private content! So, if 
you want to block access to private content, use proper authentication instead. 
 
For more information about </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">robots.txt</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">, please see:

</span><span class="s1">## </span><span class="s0">humans.txt 
 
The </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">humans.txt</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">file is used to provide information about people involved with 
the website. 
 
The provided file contains three sections: 
 
</span><span class="s1">  * </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">TEAM</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">- this is intented to list the group of people responsible for the website 
</span><span class="s1">  * </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">THANKS</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">- this is intended to list the group of people that have contributed 
  to the webste 
</span><span class="s1">  * </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">TECHNOLOGY COLOPHON</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">- the section lists technologies used to make the website 
   
For more information about </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">humans.txt</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">, please see: http://humanstxt.org/ 
 
 
</span><span class="s1">## </span><span class="s0">browserconfig.xml 
 
The </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">browserconfig.xml</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">file is used to customize the tile displayed when users 
pin your site to the Windows 8.1 start screen. In there you can define custom 
tile colors, custom images or even [live tiles](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn455106.aspx#CreatingLiveTiles). 
 
By default, the file points to 2 placeholder tile images: 
 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">tile.png</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">(558x558px): used for </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">Small</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">, </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">Medium</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">and </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">Large</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">tiles. 
  This image resizes automatically when necessary. 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">tile-wide.png</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">(558x270px): user for </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">Wide</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">tiles. 
 
Notice that IE11 uses the same images when adding a site to the </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">favorites</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">.
