</span><span class="s1"># </span><span class="s0">The HTML 
 
By default, HTML5 Boilerplate provides two </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">html</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">pages: 
 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">[</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">index.html</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">](#indexhtml) - a default HTML skeleton that should form the 
  basis of all pages on your website 
</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">[</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">404.html</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">](#404html) - a placeholder 404 error page 
 
 
</span><span class="s1">## </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">index.html</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0"> 
 
 
</span><span class="s1">### </span><span class="s0">The </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">no-js</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">Class 
 
The </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">no-js</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">class is provided in order to allow you to more easily and 
explicitly add custom styles based on whether JavaScript is disabled 
(</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">.no-js</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">) or enabled (</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">.js</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">). Using this technique also helps [avoid the 
FOUC](https://www.paulirish.com/2009/avoiding-the-fouc-v3/). 
 
 
</span><span class="s1">## </span><span class="s0">Language Attribute 
 
Please consider specifying the language of your content by adding a [value](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry) to the </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">lang</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0"> 
attribute in the </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">&lt;html&gt;</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">as in this example: 
 
</span><span class="s2">```html</span><span class="s0"> 
</span><span class="s2">&lt;html class=&quot;no-js&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;</span><span class="s0"> 
</span><span class="s2">```</span><span class="s0"> 
 
</span><span class="s1">### </span><span class="s0">The order of the </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">&lt;title&gt;</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">and </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">&lt;meta&gt;</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">tags 
 
The order in which the </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">&lt;title&gt;</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">and the </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">&lt;meta&gt;</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">tags are specified is 
important because: 
 
</span><span class="s1">1) </span><span class="s0">the charset declaration (</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">): 
 
   </span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">must be included completely within the [first 1024 bytes of the 
     document](https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/semantics.html#charset) 
 
   </span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">should be specified as early as possible (before any content that could 
     be controlled by an attacker, such as a </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">&lt;title&gt;</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">element) in order to 
     avoid a potential [encoding-related security 
     issue](https://code.google.com/p/doctype-mirror/wiki/ArticleUtf7) in 
     Internet Explorer 
 
</span><span class="s1">2) </span><span class="s0">the meta tag for compatibility mode

     tags](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc288325.aspx) 
 
 
</span><span class="s1">### </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">x-ua-compatible</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0"> 
 
Internet Explorer 8/9/10 support [document compatibility 
modes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc288325.aspx) that affect the 
way webpages are interpreted and displayed. Because of this, even if your site's 
visitor is using, let's say, Internet Explorer 9, it's possible that IE will not 
use the latest rendering engine, and instead, decide to render your page using 
the Internet Explorer 5.5 rendering engine. 
 
Specifying the </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">x-ua-compatible</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">meta tag: 
 
</span><span class="s2">```html</span><span class="s0"> 
</span><span class="s2">&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;x-ua-compatible&quot; content=&quot;ie=edge&quot;&gt;</span><span class="s0"> 
</span><span class="s2">```</span><span class="s0"> 
 
or sending the page with the following HTTP response header 
 
</span><span class="s2">```</span><span class="s0"> 
</span><span class="s2">X-UA-Compatible: IE=edge</span><span class="s0"> 
</span><span class="s2">```</span><span class="s0"> 
 
will force Internet Explorer 8/9/10 to render the webpage in the highest 
available mode in [the various cases when it may 
not](https://hsivonen.fi/doctype/#ie8), and therefore, ensure that anyone 
browsing your site is treated to the best possible user experience that 
browser can offer. 
 
If possible, we recommend that you remove the </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">meta</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">tag and send only the 
HTTP response header as the </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">meta</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">tag will not always work if your site is 
served on a non-standard port, as Internet Explorer's preference option 
</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">Display intranet sites in Compatibility View</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">is checked by default. 
 
If you are using Apache as your webserver, including the 
[</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">.htaccess</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache) file takes care of 
the HTTP header. If you are using a different server, check out our [other 
server config](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs). 
 
Starting with Internet Explorer 11, [document modes are 
deprecated](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bg182625.aspx#docmode). 
If your business still relies on older web apps and services that were 
designed for older versions of Internet Explorer, you might want to consider 
enabling [Enterprise Mode](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ie/2014/04/02/stay-up-to-date-with-enterprise-mode-for-internet-explorer-11/) throughout your company. 
 
 
</span><span class="s1">## </span><span class="s0">Meta Description 
 
The </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">description</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">meta tag provides a short description of the page.  
In some situations this description is used as a part of the snippet  
shown in the search results. 
 
</span><span class="s2">```html</span><span class="s0"> 
</span><span class="s2">&lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;This is a description&quot;&gt;</span><span class="s0"> 
</span><span class="s2">```</span><span class="s0"> 
 
 
</span><span class="s1">## </span><span class="s0">Mobile Viewport 
 
There are a few different options that you can use with the [</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">viewport</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">meta 
tag](https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dkx3qtm_22dxsrgcf4 &quot;Viewport and 
Media Queries - The Complete Idiot's Guide&quot;). You can find out more in [the 
Apple developer docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/UsingtheViewport/UsingtheViewport.html). 
HTML5 Boilerplate comes with a simple setup that strikes a good balance for general use cases. 
 
</span><span class="s2">```html</span><span class="s0"> 
</span><span class="s2">&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;&gt;</span><span class="s0"> 
</span><span class="s2">```</span><span class="s0"> 
 
</span><span class="s1">## </span><span class="s0">Web App Manifest 
HTML5 Boilerplate includes a simple web app manifest file.  
 
The web app manifest is a simple JSON file that allows you to control how your  
app appears on a device's home screen, what it looks like when it launches 
in that context and what happens when it is launched. This allows for much greater 
control over the UI of a saved site or web app on a mobile device.  
 
It's linked to from the HTML as follows: 
 
</span><span class="s2">```html</span><span class="s0"> 
</span><span class="s2">        &lt;link rel=&quot;manifest&quot; href=&quot;site.webmanifest&quot;&gt;</span><span class="s0"> 
</span><span class="s2">```</span><span class="s0"> 
Our [site.webmanifest](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/site.webmanifest) contains a very skeletal &quot;app&quot; definition, just to show the basic usage.  
You should fill this file out with [more information about your site or application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) 
 
</span><span class="s1">## </span><span class="s0">Favicons and Touch Icon 
 
The shortcut icons should be put in the root directory of your site. </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">favicon.ico</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0"> 
is automatically picked up by browsers if it's placed in the root.  HTML5 
Boilerplate comes with a default set of icons (include favicon and one Apple 
Touch Icon) that you can use as a baseline to create your own. 
 
Please refer to the more detailed description in the [Extend section](extend.md) 
of these docs. 
 
</span><span class="s1">## </span><span class="s0">The Content Area 
 
The central part of the boilerplate template is pretty much empty. This is 
intentional, in order to make the boilerplate suitable for both web page and 
web app development. 
 
</span><span class="s1">### </span><span class="s0">Browser Upgrade Prompt 
 
The main content area of the boilerplate includes a prompt to install an up to 
date browser for users of IE 8 and lower. If you intended to support IE 8, then you 
should remove the snippet of code. 
 
</span><span class="s1">## </span><span class="s0">Modernizr 
 
HTML5 Boilerplate uses a custom build of Modernizr. 
 
[Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/) is a JavaScript library which adds classes to 
the </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">html</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">element based on the results of feature test and which ensures that 
all browsers can make use of HTML5 elements (as it includes the HTML5 Shiv). 
This allows you to target parts of your CSS and JavaScript based on the 
features supported by a browser. 
 
Starting with version 3 Modernizr can be customized using the [modernizr-config.json](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/modernizr-config.json) and the 
[Modernizr command line utility](https://www.npmjs.com/package/modernizr-cli).  
 
</span><span class="s1">## </span><span class="s0">What About Polyfills? 
 
If you need to include [polyfills](https://remysharp.com/2010/10/08/what-is-a-polyfill) 
in your project, you must make sure those load before any other JavaScript. If you're 
using some polyfill CDN service, like [cdn.polyfill.io](https://cdn.polyfill.io/), 
just put it before the other scripts in the bottom of the page: 
 
</span><span class="s2">```html</span><span class="s0"> 
</span><span class="s2">    &lt;script src=&quot;js/vendor/modernizr-3.6.0.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span><span class="s0"> 
</span><span class="s2">    &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span><span class="s0"> 
</span><span class="s2">    &lt;script src=&quot;https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js&quot; integrity=&quot;sha256-FgpCb/KJQlLNfOu91ta32o/NMZxltwRo8QtmkMRdAu8=&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span><span class="s0"> 
</span><span class="s2">    &lt;script&gt;window.jQuery || document.write('&lt;script src=&quot;js/vendor/jquery-3.3.1.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;\/script&gt;')&lt;/script&gt;</span><span class="s0"> 
</span><span class="s2">    &lt;script src=&quot;js/plugins.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span><span class="s0"> 
</span><span class="s2">    &lt;script src=&quot;js/main.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span><span class="s0"> 
</span><span class="s2">&lt;/body&gt;</span><span class="s0"> 
</span><span class="s2">```</span><span class="s0"> 
 
If you like to just include the polyfills yourself, you could include them in 
</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">js/plugins.js</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">. When you have a bunch of polyfills to load in, you could 
also create a </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">polyfills.js</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">file in the </span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="s0">js/vendor</span><span class="s2">` </span><span class="s0">directory or include the files  
individually and combine them using a build tool. Always ensure that the polyfills  
are all loaded before any other JavaScript. 
 
There are some misconceptions about Modernizr and polyfills. It's important 
to understand that Modernizr just handles feature checking, not polyfilling 
itself. The only thing Modernizr does regarding polyfills is that the team 
maintains [a huge list of cross Browser polyfills](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-Browser-Polyfills). 
 
</span><span class="s1">### </span><span class="s0">jQuery CDN for jQuery 
 
The jQuery CDN version of the jQuery JavaScript library is referenced towards 
the bottom of the page. A local fallback of jQuery is included for rare instances 
when the CDN version might not be available, and to facilitate offline 
development. 
 
The jQuery CDN version was chosen over other potential candidates 
([like Google's Hosted Libraries](https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/)) 
because it's fast ([comparable or faster than Google by some 
measures](https://www.cdnperf.com/#jsdelivr,cdnjs,google,yandex,microsoft,jquery,bootstrapcdn/https/90)) 
and, (unlike Google's CDN) is available to China's hundreds of millions of internet users. 
For many years we [chose](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/issues/1191) 
the Google Hosted version over the jQuery CDN because it was available 
over HTTPS (the jQuery CDN was not,) and it offered a better chance of 
hitting the cache lottery owing to the popularity of the Google CDN. 
The first issue is no longer valid and the second is far outweighed by 
being able to serve jQuery to Chinese users. 
 
While the jQuery CDN is a strong default solution your site or application may 
require a different configuration. Testing your site with services like 
[WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/) and browser tools like 
[PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) will help you examine the real 
world performance of your site and can show where you can optimize your specific 
site or application. 
 
</span><span class="s1">### </span><span class="s0">Google Universal Analytics Tracking Code 
 
Finally, an optimized version of the Google Universal Analytics tracking code is 
included. Google recommends that this script be placed at the top of the page. 
Factors to consider: if you place this script at the top of the page, you’ll 
be able to count users who don’t fully load the page, and you’ll incur the max 
number of simultaneous connections of the browser.

  Snippet](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/async-analytics-snippet#universal-analytics)

</span><span class="s1">* </span><span class="s0">[Google Analytics Demos &amp; Tools](https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/) 
 
**N.B.** The Google Universal Analytics snippet is included by default mainly 
because Google Analytics is [currently one of the most popular tracking 
solutions](https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Google-Analytics) out there. 
However, its usage isn't set in stone, and you SHOULD consider exploring the 
[alternatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_analytics_software) 
and use whatever suits your needs best!
